# Chicken for Windows

Hello hi I'm having a lot of fun with this little guy. I made it using paint.net hence the pdn file.

## Requirements

Everything's in the requirement.txt, you can pip install all of these!

## The code

Just run the code as it is and it should work without any issues!

## What da lil guy do?

What he does is he launches stuff for you! Well I hardcoded what he can launch because everything has a different path, so the code is messy and ugly, I'll work on it more if I want to one day.

Wait a good second after he finished speaking and he will gladly listen to "start + 'your word here'", I tried doing it in french with "lance" but all I ended up doing is to make him answer to some guy named Lance but with a very strong english accent.

*- Lence discord* I whisper to the chicken.
